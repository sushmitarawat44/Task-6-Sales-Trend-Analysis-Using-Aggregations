## üéØ Online Sales Trend Analysis

### üìå Objective
Analyze **monthly revenue** and **order volume** trends using SQL.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- SQLite (via SQLiteStudio)
- SQL (Standard Syntax)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing (Manual Edits in Excel)
Before importing the dataset into SQLite for query analysis, the following manual data cleaning steps were performed using Microsoft Excel:

Filling Missing Values

Review Score: Calculated the average review score (‚âà 4) and filled all missing values in the review_score column using Excel's filter and replace functionality.

Gender: Replaced blank entries in the gender column with "Unknown" to ensure consistency and avoid null-related issues in analysis.

Formatting Date Values

Order Date: The original order_date column was in dd/mm/yyyy format, which SQLite does not parse natively. Used Text to Columns with / as a delimiter to split the date.
Reordered the columns into the format yyyy-mm-dd. Used Format Cells ‚Üí Custom ‚Üí yyyy-mm-dd to apply the new format.
Recombined and saved the file before importing into SQLite.

##üß† Query Logic

`Extract month from order date`
SELECT 
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month
FROM Online_Sales
LIMIT 10;

`Group by Year and Month`
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Online_Sales
GROUP BY year, month
LIMIT 10;

`Use SUM() for Monthly Revenue`
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Online_Sales
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
LIMIT 10;

`Use COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) for Order Volume`
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id || '-' || order_date) AS order_volume
FROM Online_Sales
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
LIMIT 10;

`Use ORDER BY to Sort Results (Descending)`
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM Online_Sales
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC
LIMIT 10;

`Limit to a Specific Year (e.g., 2022)`
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
  strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id || '-' || order_date) AS order_volume
FROM Online_Sales
WHERE strftime('%Y', order_date) = '2024'
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY month;

`Monthly revenue and order volume trend`

SELECT 
    strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
    strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date || '-' || customer_id) AS order_volume
FROM 
    Online_Sales
GROUP BY 
    year, month
ORDER BY 
    year, month
LIMIT 10;`
